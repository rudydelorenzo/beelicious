# beelicious
Want to send your friends the script to the bee movie?

## Requirements
* You must have Python installed, it's available at `https://www.python.org/downloads/`.
* You must have the Pynput library installed. It can be installed by running `pip install pynput`.

## Instructions
1. Download the file `beelicious.py` from above.
1. Launch your terminal app of choice (I use the default macOS terminal, which comes with Python preinstalled!).
2. Navigate to the location where you saved "beelicious.py" by typing `cd /path/to/beelicious/`.

	_If you downloaded it into your downloads folder, running_ `cd Downloads` _should do the trick._
3. Run the script by typing `python beelicious.py`.
4. You now have 3 seconds to click whatever text field you want to type the movie's script into.

	_This could be, for example, the box where you'd type a message in iMessage._
5. Profit!

_NOTE: Beelicious has only been tested on macOS. It'll work on other platforms as well, but the setup will differ slightly from what's indicated in the instructions above_
