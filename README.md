Want to send your friends the script to the bee movie?

## Requirements
* You must have Python installed, it's available at `https://www.python.org/downloads/`.
* You must have the Pynput library installed. It can be installed by running `pip install pynput` _or_ `pip3 install pynput` if you're running Python 3.

## Instructions (Python 2)
1. Download the file `beelicious2.py` from above.
1. Launch your terminal app of choice (I use the default macOS terminal, which comes with Python preinstalled!).
2. Navigate to the folder that you saved "beelicious.py" to by typing `cd /path/to/beelicious/`.

	_If you downloaded it into your downloads folder, running_ `cd ~/Downloads` _should do the trick._
3. Run the script by typing `python beelicious2.py`.
4. You now have 3 seconds to click whatever text field you want to type the movie's script into.

	_This could be, for example, the box where you'd type a message in iMessage._
5. Profit!
